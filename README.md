## Introduction
Stacy works for a **restaurant** group as an Area manager, and has been tasked
with improving labour deployment across her sites in Central London, particularly during busy meal periods.

She has collected the headcount staffed at different meal periods across sites,and the respective sales generated in 2023. She is keen to use the data to determine the headcount that her sites should staff at each meal period going forward.

This project aims to create a model that would enable us to predict the ``ideal headcount`` for each meal period across each site.

## Slides
You can find an explanation on the model [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EAcGkzY3-dqzfyitSEOFyJ8EHPHJql47761Pa_I8CwM/edit?usp=sharing).
